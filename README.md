# PDF-AudioBook Converter
This is a python script that allows the user to convert a PDF into an audiobook easily.

### Features
Two notable features were implemented:
1. Playing a generated audiobook immediately. This feature was implemented using the pyttsx3 package (Python Text To Speech).
2. Saving the audiobook as a file so it can be referred to later on. This feature was implented using the gtts package (Google Text To Speech).

NOTE: It is imperative that if a user is to save the audiobook file, the user must be connected to the Internet as this feature leverages the Google Text To Speech API.
